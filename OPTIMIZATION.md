# Domyan Luxury Architecture - Performance Optimizations

## Overview
This document outlines the performance optimizations and improvements made to the Domyan Luxury Architecture website to enhance user experience, loading speed, and accessibility.

## üöÄ Performance Improvements

### 1. Image Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Implemented intersection observer-based lazy loading for all images
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Added loading skeletons and fallback images
- **Priority Loading**: Hero images load immediately, others load on demand
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for failed image loads

### 2. Component Optimization
- **Memoization**: Used `useMemo` and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Custom Hooks**: Created performance-aware hooks for device detection
- **Code Splitting**: Separated heavy components into optimized modules

### 3. Animation Performance
- **Device Detection**: Automatically detects mobile devices and low-end hardware
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects user's `prefers-reduced-motion` preference
- **Throttled Updates**: Limited animation frame updates to 60fps
- **Mobile Optimization**: Disabled heavy animations on mobile devices

### 4. Custom Cursor Optimization
- **Mobile Detection**: Automatically hidden on mobile devices
- **Throttled Movement**: Reduced cursor update frequency for better performance
- **RequestAnimationFrame**: Used RAF for smooth cursor movement
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of event listeners
