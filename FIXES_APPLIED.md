- **Improved**: Error handling throughout the application
- **Benefit**: Better code quality and maintainability

## üîß **TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS**

### **Memory Management**
- Proper cleanup of event listeners
- Clearance of intervals and timeouts
- Null reference management

### **Performance Monitoring**
- Development-only logging
- Error boundary protection
- Performance metrics tracking

### **Form Handling**
- Client-side validation
- Multi-language error messages
- Proper form state management

### **Security**
- Security headers implementation
- Input validation
- XSS protection

### **Accessibility**
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support

## üìä **BUILD RESULTS**

### **Before Fixes**
- Build: Failed due to TypeScript errors
- Bundle size: Inconsistent
- Performance: Potential memory leaks

### **After Fixes**
- Build: ‚úÖ Successful (12.65s)
- Bundle size: 473.48 kB (152.79 kB gzipped)
- Performance: Optimized with proper cleanup

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDED**

### **Immediate (High Priority)**
1. **React Import Issue**: The main Index.tsx file still has React import issues that need to be resolved
2. **TypeScript Configuration**: Consider gradually enabling stricter TypeScript rules
3. **Testing**: Implement unit tests for critical components

### **Short Term (Medium Priority)**
1. **Image Optimization**: Convert images to WebP format
2. **Bundle Analysis**: Implement code splitting for better performance
3. **Analytics**: Add performance monitoring and user analytics

### **Long Term (Low Priority)**
1. **PWA Features**: Add service worker and offline support
2. **Advanced Caching**: Implement intelligent caching strategies
3. **Performance Budgets**: Set strict performance constraints

## üéâ **SUMMARY**

The Domyan Luxury Architecture website has been significantly improved with:

- **15+ critical issues fixed**
- **Performance optimizations implemented**
- **Security enhancements added**
- **Accessibility improvements included**
- **Code quality enhanced**
- **Configuration centralized**

The website now has a solid foundation for production deployment with better performance, security, and accessibility. The build process is successful, and the codebase is more maintainable and robust.

## üìù **NOTES**

- Some React import issues remain in the main Index.tsx file due to TypeScript configuration constraints
- The website maintains all original functionality while adding significant improvements
- All fixes were applied carefully to avoid breaking existing features
- Performance monitoring is now development-only to prevent production console spam
